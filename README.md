# SuperMarioBros

This was a recreation of the original NES game of Super Mario Bros. This project was written in Python, using the PyCharm IDE. In this project, only the first level of the game has been made, and not all of the features are there. This was one of my first few exposures
to using Python, and despite the flaws, I'm proud of the result.

Works
-Player can move and jump
-Side scrolling works
-Game has working menu
-Game shows pre-level start screen
-Player can lose by falling in pits

Doesn't Really Work
-Physics aren't quite right
-Collision is finicky between the player and blocks, walls, etc.
-Interactions with blocks, enemies, etc. are not fully implemented.
